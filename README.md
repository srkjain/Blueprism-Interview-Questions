1. ### What is Blue Prism?

	Blue Prism is one of the leading software development companies in the automation area. It is a UK-based company helping organizations with one of its popular RPA tools, Blue Prism. The term RPA, which is an acronym of **'Robotic Process Automation'**, was first introduced by the Blue Prism group.

	The Blue Prism tool is primarily designed to create software robots (also called bots). These software robots are nothing but a set of pre-defined commands that help automate rule-based, repetitive tasks, and eliminate or reduce humans work.

2. ### What does RPA stand for?

	RPA is the short form of ***Robotic Process Automation***. RPA is a special kind of automation technique in which software robots perform a human's tasks. These tasks generally include repetitive, rule-based, and manual processes. The technique helps organizations automate their digital processes across various applications and systems without changing the existing systems or IT infrastructure.

* **Robotic:** Set of codes that acts like a robot and mimic human actions.

* **Process:** Sequence of steps that creates a meaningful activity is known as the process.

* **Automation:** The process performed by software robots without human interaction.

4. ### What are the main components of the RPA Blue Prism?

	There are several components present in the Blue Prism tool. However, the main components are:

	* Process Studio
	* Object Studio
	
	**Process Studio:** A process studio is defined as the area in the Blue Prism tool that allows developers to create process diagrams for the processes to be automated. The process studio consists of various options, such as variables, control loops, object calls, and business logic, etc. Every process created here includes the Main Page that is executed first.

	**Object Studio:** To automate most business processes, organizations must establish communication with external software or applications. Since Process Studio does not allow this, Object Studio is included in Blue Prism to perform this functionality. Object Studio allows developers to create VBO (Visual Business Objects).
