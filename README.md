1. ### What is Blue Prism?

	Blue Prism is one of the leading software development companies in the automation area. It is a UK-based company helping organizations with one of its popular RPA tools, Blue Prism. The term RPA, which is an acronym of **'Robotic Process Automation'**, was first introduced by the Blue Prism group.

	The Blue Prism tool is primarily designed to create software robots (also called bots). These software robots are nothing but a set of pre-defined commands that help automate rule-based, repetitive tasks, and eliminate or reduce humans work.

2. ### What does RPA stand for?

	RPA is the short form of ***Robotic Process Automation***. RPA is a special kind of automation technique in which software robots perform a human's tasks. These tasks generally include repetitive, rule-based, and manual processes. The technique helps organizations automate their digital processes across various applications and systems without changing the existing systems or IT infrastructure.

* **Robotic:** Set of codes that acts like a robot and mimic human actions.

* **Process:** Sequence of steps that creates a meaningful activity is known as the process.

* **Automation:** The process performed by software robots without human interaction.

4. ### What are the main components of the RPA Blue Prism?

	There are several components present in the Blue Prism tool. However, the main components are:

	* Process Studio
	* Object Studio
	
	**Process Studio:** A process studio is defined as the area in the Blue Prism tool that allows developers to create process diagrams for the processes to be automated. The process studio consists of various options, such as variables, control loops, object calls, and business logic, etc. Every process created here includes the Main Page that is executed first.

	**Object Studio:** To automate most business processes, organizations must establish communication with external software or applications. Since Process Studio does not allow this, Object Studio is included in Blue Prism to perform this functionality. Object Studio allows developers to create VBO (Visual Business Objects).

5. ### What is the role of VBO in Blue Prism?
	
	VBO is a short form of **"Visual Business Objects"**. These are the diagrammatic programs that can be created in Object Studio.

	These visual business objects provide an interface that can interact with external applications. The interface cannot be formed by using Process Studio; it is only generated using the environment given in the Object Studio within the Blue Prism tool.

6. ### What are the types of security options available in the Blue Prism tool?

	There are mainly three different types of security controls available in RPA Blue Prism, such as User, Credentials, and Options.

	**Security Type	       Used for**
	* **User :**	Assigning new user information.
	* **Credentials:**	Storing secret information.
	* **Options: **	Assigning rules for setting passwords.

	Besides, Blue Prism also offers role-based access management for increased security. It is used to assign a specific role to any particular user. The user cannot perform actions other than assigned ones. Apart from this, the administrator also gets control over user activities. For example, an admin can check when a user has logged in into the Blue Prism, started or deleted process, and many other activities.
